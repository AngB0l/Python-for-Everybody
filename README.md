# Python-for-Everybody
Learning Python with Python for everybody Specialization
Thank you for visiting my page
These are my solutions to the exercises in Dr. Charles R. Severance book: Python for Everybody.
You can find the book and the files I used to process the data and the book if you visit: https://www.py4e.com/

Though there are definitely slicker solutions for the exercises keep in mind that they are for absolute beginners.
Hope that this code helps if someone is a beginner too!
